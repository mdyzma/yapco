**YAPCO** (*Yet Another Planner Creator*) turns a planner **template** into a complete, dated,
print-ready planner in **A4** (210 × 297 mm) or **A5** (148 × 210 mm): hundreds of pages laid
out for two-sided printing, with mirrored margins for the binding, in Polish or English. You print it blank on your own printer, fill it in by
hand and put it in a ring binder.

The first template is **"Dzień po Dniu" / "Day by Day"**, a six-month planner for everyday life,
balance and a good life. It comes in three editions, from the simplest to the most structured:
**Basic**, **Balance** (wellbeing, in neutral everyday wording) and **Recovery Edition**, for
recovery from addiction; see [what each edition contains](docs/editions.md). The second, **"Tydzień po Tygodniu" /
"Week by Week"**, is a simple weekly planner for up to a year, made from the same engine.

## What you can do

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 🗓️ **Generate a whole planner** | Pick a template, edition, format (A4 or A5), language, start date and length; YAPCO lays out every month, week and day, 500+ pages for six months. |
| 📐 **A4 and A5** | Every page is designed for both formats, not just scaled: A5 gets its own layout where space is tight (a two-line check-in, fewer writing lines, compact contacts on the crisis plan). Switch the format at any time; your edits carry over. A5 can also print two per A4 sheet. |
| 🧩 **Switch modules on and off** | Editions are presets of modules (recovery, HALT-B, wellbeing, CBT situation analysis, "A good start", mindfulness, productivity). Wording, pages and blocks follow what is on. |
| ✏️ **Design visually** | A three-panel designer: page structure, a real-size canvas with guides and binding margins, and a properties panel. Edit one page or every page made from the same template. |
| 🌍 **Work in two languages** | Every text has Polish and English side by side, including gendered Polish wording; the app itself is bilingual. |
| 🖨️ **Print at home** | PDF export for two-sided printers or by-hand duplex, 2-up A5 on A4, a calibration sheet, and one month at a time for a ring binder. |
| 📖 **Show how to use it** | Example filling in grey handwriting, and a printable guide that explains every page. |
| 🔒 **Keep it private** | Planners are stored only in the browser (IndexedDB); export them as JSON for backups. No accounts, no server database. |
| 📴 **Works offline** | Installable as an app (PWA); after the first visit it opens and works without a connection. Only PDF creation needs the export service; printing from the browser works offline. |

### One template, any kind of planner

The same template makes a simple day planner, a wellbeing journal or a full therapeutic
recovery planner: three editions that scale from the simplest to the most structured
([what each contains](docs/editions.md)). The pages below are the same day in each edition,
with the example filling switched on.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="33%">Basic</th>
    <th width="33%">Balance</th>
    <th width="33%">Recovery Edition (+ CBT)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="docs/images/readme/day-basic.png"><img src="docs/images/readme/day-basic.png" alt="Day spread, basic planner"></a></td>
    <td><a href="docs/images/readme/day-balance.png"><img src="docs/images/readme/day-balance.png" alt="Day spread, Balance edition"></a></td>
    <td><a href="docs/images/readme/day-recovery.png"><img src="docs/images/readme/day-recovery.png" alt="Day spread, Recovery Edition"></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The simplest: three priorities with dots under each, the plan of the day, and an evening
    page of dots with gratitude.</td>
    <td>Wellbeing with some structure: a check-in and check-out, what helped, the evening
    reflection and "A good life"; neutral everyday wording.</td>
    <td>Sobriety days, craving scales, HALT-B, triggers and what protected me; the crisis section
    and the weekly CBT situation analysis.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The recovery set-up goes as far as a therapeutic workbook: a weekly review with a situation
analysis, and a crisis plan with the SOBER pause, contacts and safe places.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="66%"><a href="docs/images/readme/recovery-cbt.png"><img src="docs/images/readme/recovery-cbt.png" alt="Weekly review and CBT situation analysis"></a></td>
    <td width="34%"><a href="docs/images/readme/recovery-crisis.png"><img src="docs/images/readme/recovery-crisis.png" alt="Crisis plan: my plan for a hard moment"></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"My week" and "Situation analysis" (CBT module)</td>
    <td>"My plan for a hard moment" (crisis section)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### The app

**Create a planner.** Pick the template, edition and modules, format, language and dates; the
page count and spine width update as you go. Each set-up above is one planner on the list.

![Dashboard with the new-planner form and three planners](docs/images/readme/dashboard.png)

**Design the pages.** Browse the planner's sections and pages on the left, lay out the page in
the visual designer in the centre, and adjust every element to your needs in the properties
panel on the right.

![Planner designer](docs/images/readme/designer.png)

**Explain it.** A printable guide walks through every page of the chosen edition with a
filled-in example.

![Guide: how to fill in the planner](docs/images/readme/guide.png)

**Print it.** Pick the parts to print and how your printer handles two-sided pages.

![Export settings](docs/images/readme/export.png)

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Node.js 24 (see `.nvmrc`; 22+ works), pnpm through Corepack, and Google
Chrome for PDF export.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdyzma/yapco.git
cd yapco
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts the app on <http://localhost:3000> and the local PDF export service on
`:8787`, which drives your installed Chrome ([apps/export-node](apps/export-node/README.md)).

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | App and export service in watch mode |
| `pnpm check` | Lint, typecheck, tests and build, the same as CI |
| `pnpm test` | All unit tests (Vitest) |
| `pnpm --filter @planner/template-therapeutic-recovery build:template` | Rebuild `template.json` after editing the template source (`@planner/template-weekly-planner` for the weekly one) |
| `pnpm --filter @planner/export-node pdf <planner.json>` | Make a PDF from the command line |
| `pnpm --filter @planner/docs dev` | The user documentation on <http://localhost:4321/docs/> |

For everyday use (printing a month, backups, updating, troubleshooting) see the
**[runbook](docs/operations/runbook.md)**.

## How it works

```text
template (TS → JSON)  ──►  generator  ──►  planner document  ──►  renderer  ──►  PDF
   pages, blocks,          dates, months,     pages with sides,     React in mm,     Chrome
   modules, presets        weeks, quotes      overrides, modules    print CSS        print
```

- A **template** describes sections, page templates and blocks, with Polish and English text in
  the same record. Modules and presets decide which pages print and which wording a block uses
  ([ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-modules-presets-and-block-variants.md)).
- The **generator** expands the template for a start date and length into concrete pages, knows
  which side each page falls on, and inserts fillers so that sections start on the right side.
- The **designer** edits either one page or the page template it came from; your edits survive
  regenerating the planner.
- The **renderer** draws pages in real millimetres; Chrome prints them to PDF, so text stays
  vector and sizes are exact.

Built with TypeScript, React 19, Next.js 16, next-intl, Zod 4, Zustand, dnd-kit, Tailwind CSS,
Dexie, Vitest, Turborepo and pnpm.

## Documentation

**User documentation** (Polish and English): getting started, self-hosting, how-to guides and
developer notes. It lives in [apps/docs](apps/docs/src/content/docs/), is built with Astro
Starlight, and is served at `/docs` next to the app (the *Documentation* link in the app). Run it
locally with `pnpm --filter @planner/docs dev`.
